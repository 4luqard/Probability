# CS109 Problem Sets

This folder contains the problem sets for the CS109 course taught at Stanford University. Each problem set folder contains a PDF file with the problems, a PDF file with the solutions for the written problems inside the problem set, a Python file containing the code for the code problems inside the problem set, a markdown file which contains the solution for the theoretical probability for each code problem, and a Python file for unit testing the code problems.
